Installation
Instructions for installing the SUSHI tool on your system
Step 1: Install Node.js
SUSHI requires Node.js. To install Node.js, go to https://nodejs.org/ and select the “LTS” download. If the download is not appropriate for your operating system, click the “Other Downloads” link to get a full list of downloads. Once the installer is downloaded, run it using the default options.

Ensure that Node.js is correctly installed by opening a command window and typing the following two commands. Each command should return a version number.

 node --version
 npm --version
Step 2: Install SUSHI
To install SUSHI, open up a command prompt and type the following command:

 npm install -g fsh-sushi
Check the installation via the command below:

 sushi --help

 Setting up a fully-featured FSH project can be complex, so SUSHI provides an --init argument to do it automatically. When sushi --init is run, SUSHI will request project information from the user:

 $ sushi build .


Step 5: Generate the Sample IG 
At the command prompt, enter:


   _updatePublisher
  ./_updatePublisher.sh
